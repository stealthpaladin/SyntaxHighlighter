# What's next?

SyntaxHighlighter is one of the most popular highlighters on the web today. I'm surprised 
and excited to see it on nearly every other blog out there. It's pretty awesome!

Unfortunately I haven't had much time to up keep the project and I'm looking for help! Over
the last months I've been thinking about the next iteration and have a bunch of interesting
ideas on where to take this project... but I'm in desperate need of help on this. If you are
interested in joining, drop me a note! Lets write the next version together!


## Why The Fork? (goals for my fork of the project)

1. Use syntax definitions to make class generation wizard requiring only the given definition files.
2. Attempt to derrive enough language agnostic context from similar data primtives and structure definitions to feed a trie-based autocomplete
3. However far #2 achieves, tie together with already designed trie-based feed access to provide editable code definitions on lookup.


That would be just great. -stealth
